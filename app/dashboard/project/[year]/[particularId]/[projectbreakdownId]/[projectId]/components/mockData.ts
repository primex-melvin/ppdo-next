  summary: "The Q4 2024 budget report highlights a strong overall performance with an 80% utilization rate in key development programs. [cite_start]The highest obligation is noted in the 'Program for anti-illegal drug, illegal gambling, counter-insurgency' category (C)[cite: 524]. [cite_start]Overall, the department maintains a healthy $38.2 million balance across all major accounts[cite: 525]. [cite_start]A key finding is the low obligation rate in the 'Crime Prevention and law enforcement' category (9.3%) [cite: 526][cite_start], indicating potential delays in procurement or implementation which should be inspected[cite: 526].",
  recommendations: [
    "Immediately review procurement schedules for Section A (Crime Prevention) to address the low obligation rate[cite: 528].",
    "Allocate a contingency fund to manage the near-complete depletion of the Indigency Fund (C.3).",
