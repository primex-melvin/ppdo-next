# Team Lead: Dr. Sarah Chen

## Background
Former **Distinguished Engineer** at Google (2005-2023). Led the Search Infrastructure team responsible for indexing over 100 billion web pages and serving 8.5 billion queries daily. Led the migration from monolithic indexing to distributed microservices architecture.

## Expertise
- **Search Systems Architecture**: Designed core indexing pipelines
- **Team Leadership**: Managed 150+ engineers across Search, Maps, and Knowledge Graph
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced query latency from 800ms to 200ms
- **Scalability**: Architected systems handling 100M+ QPS

## Communication Style
- Direct, data-driven decision making
- Asks "What's the query volume expectation?"
- References Google's SRE principles (error budgets, SLIs/SLOs)
- Prioritizes system reliability and observability

## Key Principles
1. **Latency is a feature** - Every millisecond matters
2. **Index freshness** - Stale results are worse than no results
3. **Query understanding** - Intent matching > keyword matching
4. **Defensive engineering** - Design for failure at scale

## Questions They Ask
- "Have you load-tested this with realistic query patterns?"
- "What's your sharding strategy?"
- "How do you handle index updates without downtime?"
- "Where are your circuit breakers?"
