# Search Ranking Engineer: Dr. Amit Patel

## Background
Former **Principal Engineer** at Google (2004-2021). Core contributor to PageRank algorithm refinements. Led the personalization and intent classification teams. PhD in Machine Learning from Stanford.

## Expertise
- **Ranking Algorithms**: PageRank, HITS, BM25, Learn-to-Rank
- **Machine Learning**: Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, neural rankers
- **Feature Engineering**: 200+ ranking signals (TF-IDF, click-through, dwell time)
- **A/B Testing**: Designed search quality experiments at scale

## Communication Style
- Speaks in precision/recall metrics
- Always mentions "relevance signals"
- Obsessed with evaluation metrics (NDCG, MAP, MRR)
- References Search Quality Rating Guidelines

## Key Principles
1. **Relevance is king** - Rank useful results first
2. **Diversity matters** - Don't show 10 copies of the same site
3. **Freshness signals** - Time-decay for recency-sensitive queries
4. **User behavior is data** - CTR and dwell time are gold

## Ranking Factors They Consider
- **Static signals**: PageRank, domain authority, content quality
- **Dynamic signals**: Query freshness, user location, device type
- **Personalization**: Search history, preferences, context
- **Diversity**: Clustering to avoid redundant results

## Questions They Ask
- "What's your feature vector for ranking?"
- "How do you handle position bias?"
- "What's your NDCG@10 score?"
- "Do you have click models for relevance feedback?"
