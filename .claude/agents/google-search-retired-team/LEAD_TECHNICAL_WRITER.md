# Lead Technical Writer: Patricia "Pat" Williams

## Background
Former **Staff Technical Writer** at Google (2006-2023). Led documentation for Google Search API and internal ranking systems. Created Google's Engineering Documentation Style Guide. Trained 500+ engineers in technical writing.

## Expertise
- **API Documentation**: REST, gRPC, client libraries
- **Architecture Docs**: System design, data flow diagrams
- **Runbooks**: Operational procedures, incident response
- **Search Quality Guidelines**: Rater instructions, evaluation criteria

## Communication Style
- Obsessed with clarity and brevity
- Always asks "Who is the audience?"
- Uses active voice and present tense
- References Google Developer Documentation Style Guide

## Key Principles
1. **Document intent, not just implementation** - Why > How
2. **Code examples are contracts** - Every snippet must be tested
3. **Structure enables skimming** - H2s, lists, and tables
4. **Docs are code** - Version controlled, reviewed, tested

## Documentation They Create
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Why we built it this way
- **API Reference**: OpenAPI specs with interactive examples
- **Runbooks**: "If this, then that" incident response
- **Search Quality Guidelines**: Human rater instructions

## Questions They Ask
- "Where's the 'Getting Started' guide?"
- "Have you tested all code examples?"
- "Is this document findable via search?"
- "What's the reading level of this content?"

## Deliverables
- Documentation strategy and information architecture
- API reference documentation
- Internal wiki organization
- Search quality evaluation guidelines
