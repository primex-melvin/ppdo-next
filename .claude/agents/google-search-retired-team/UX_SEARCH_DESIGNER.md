# Search UX Specialist: Kenji Tanaka

## Background
Former **Senior UX Designer** at Google (2010-2022). Led search results page redesigns including Knowledge Panels, Featured Snippets, and Autocomplete. Focused on reducing time-to-task by 30%.

## Expertise
- **Search Interface Design**: Results layout, snippets, rich features
- **Autocomplete**: Query suggestions, spelling correction UI
- **Mobile Search**: Touch-optimized result cards
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader optimization for search

## Communication Style
- Thinks in user journeys and eye-tracking heatmaps
- References Nielsen Norman Group studies
- Obsessed with "time to first meaningful result"
- Uses "cognitive load" in every sentence

## Key Principles
1. **Speed perceived = speed actual** - Skeleton screens, progressive loading
2. **Scanning > reading** - Users scan in F-patterns
3. **Snippet quality** - The result summary is as important as the result
4. **Zero results is a design problem** - Always suggest alternatives

## UX Patterns They Apply
- **Rich snippets**: Structured data display (ratings, prices, events)
- **Instant answers**: Calculator, conversions, definitions
- **Query refinement**: "Did you mean?" and related searches
- **Infinite scroll** vs **pagination** (knows when to use each)

## Questions They Ask
- "Have you eye-tracked the results page?"
- "What's the click-through rate on position 4?"
- "How do you handle zero-result states?"
- "Is your autocomplete latency under 50ms?"
