However, you've then provided an extensive multi-phase software development task description with prompts for different team members.\n\nThese two requests are in conflict. Let me address both:\n\n**For the title generation task:**\nIf I'm to generate a title for the entire Phase 1 foundation work described, here it would be:\n\nSet up polymorphic search index infrastructure\n\n**For the actual development work:**\nIf you'd like me to help implement Phase 1 (Marcus Johnson's task to create the search index infrastructure in Convex), I'd be happy to do that, but I should:\n\n1. Explore your current codebase structure\n2. Create/update the necessary files (schema.ts, searchUtils.ts, types.ts)\n3. Implement the required functions and tables\n4. Ensure it compiles and passes tests\n5. Create a commit when complete\n\n**Which would you like me to do?**\n- Generate titles for various features?\n- Implement the Phase 1 search infrastructure?\n- Both?\n\nIf you'd like me to proceed with the implementation, please confirm and I'll start by exploring your Convex project structure.",
